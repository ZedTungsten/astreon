Deploy notes:
- In Vercel Project Settings add:
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL
  NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY

- For server-only operations, store SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY in Vercel as a Project Secret and only reference it from API routes or Edge Functions.

- Set Vercel framework preset to Next.js for automatic builds.

- To test locally create .env.local with the two NEXT_PUBLIC_* vars and run:
  npm install
  npm run dev
